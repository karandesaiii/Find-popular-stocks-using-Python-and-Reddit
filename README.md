# Find & analyze popular stocks on reddit using Python

This notebook ranks finds the most popular stocks (tickers) on any reddit discussion
Similar to www.wsbdaily.com but - 

While wsbdaily.com describes last 24 hours, I describe based on user-specified number of hours to look back.

Ex : It finds most popular stocks in last 3 hours or last any number of hours as specified by you.

Also helps to view all comments which talk about a particular stock

# Requirements
Python 3.7+ should work ideally.
